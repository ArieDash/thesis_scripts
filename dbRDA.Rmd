Use Gower's distance (it has the highest value and is godd or mixed categorical and continuous data).

dbRDA = dbrda(expr~Control+Relaxation+Upwelling, conditions, dist = "gow", na.action = na.exclude)
dbRDA
#if any condition variables don't show up in plot, it is because they were aliased and are linearly dependent on another variable

plot(dbRDA)
